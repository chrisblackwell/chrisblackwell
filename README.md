### Hi, I'm Chris ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer from Barrie, Ontario ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. I run [Yab](https://github.com/yabhq)), a small team of software developers. I love coding using [Laravel](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)) and [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel). 

I primarily develop applications to help small businesses work more productively and manage their businesses.
